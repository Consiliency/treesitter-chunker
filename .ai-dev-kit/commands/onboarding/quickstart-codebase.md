# Quickstart Codebase

Comprehensive onboarding workflow for understanding and working with an existing codebase.
Combines multiple skills into a single cohesive output.

## Inputs

- `$1` = Project path (default: current directory)

## Outputs

Begin with a short control-plane reminder that Claude Code (ai-dev-kit plugin) orchestrates the workflow.
Encourage delegation to other agents via `/ai-dev-kit:delegate <provider> "<task>"` when they are better suited.

Creates `ONBOARDING.md` in the project root with:
- Technology stack summary
- Coding standards and conventions
- Documentation sources
- Architecture overview (C4 context diagram)
- Quick start commands

## Workflow

### 1. Validate Project Path

```bash
PROJECT_ROOT="${1:-.}"
cd "$PROJECT_ROOT" || exit 1
```

Verify this is a code project (has git, has manifest files, etc.):
```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
```

### 2. Library Detection

Use the `library-detection` skill to identify the technology stack:

```
Invoke the library-detection skill for: $PROJECT_ROOT

Expected output:
- languages: [list]
- frameworks: [list with versions and categories]
- test_frameworks: [list]
- build_tools: [list]
- databases: [list]
- manifests_found: [list]
```

Store results as `STACK_INFO`.

### 3. Standards Extraction

Use the `standards-extraction` skill to identify coding conventions:

```
Invoke the standards-extraction skill for: $PROJECT_ROOT

Check files:
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- .editorconfig
- .prettierrc / .prettierrc.json
- .eslintrc / eslint.config.js
- pyproject.toml [tool.ruff] / [tool.black]
- .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
```

Store results as `STANDARDS_INFO`.

### 4. Documentation Discovery

Based on detected stack, identify relevant documentation sources:

For each framework/library in `STACK_INFO.frameworks`:
1. Check if docs exist in `ai-docs/libraries/`
2. If not, suggest adding via `/ai-dev-kit:docs-add`

Map common libraries to doc sources:
| Library | Doc Source |
|---------|------------|
| react | https://react.dev |
| next | https://nextjs.org/docs |
| fastapi | https://fastapi.tiangolo.com |
| django | https://docs.djangoproject.com |
| vue | https://vuejs.org/guide |

Store as `DOCS_RECOMMENDATIONS`.

### 5. Architecture Exploration (Optional)

If the project has more than 10 files of primary language code:

```
Use the architecture-explorer subagent to build a C4 context diagram.

Focus on:
- Entry points
- External dependencies
- Key components
```

Store as `ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY`.

### 6. Generate Onboarding Document

Create `ONBOARDING.md`:

```markdown
# Codebase Onboarding Guide

> Auto-generated by `/ai-dev-kit:quickstart-codebase` on [DATE]

## Technology Stack

[From STACK_INFO]

### Languages
- [list with primary indicator]

### Frameworks
| Name | Version | Category |
|------|---------|----------|
| ... | ... | ... |

### Test Frameworks
- [list]

### Build Tools
- [list]

## Coding Standards

[From STANDARDS_INFO]

### Formatting
- [indentation, line length, etc.]

### Linting Rules
- [key rules or config file location]

### Commit Conventions
- [from CONTRIBUTING.md or inferred]

### PR Process
- [from templates or CONTRIBUTING.md]

## Documentation Sources

### Available in ai-docs/
- [list of already-tracked libraries]

### Recommended to Add
- [list with /ai-dev-kit:docs-add commands]

## Architecture Overview

[From ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY or basic structure]

### Entry Points
- [main files, CLI commands, etc.]

### Key Components
- [major modules/packages]

### External Dependencies
- [APIs, databases, services]

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
[install commands based on stack]
```

### Development
```bash
[dev server commands]
```

### Testing
```bash
[test commands based on test_frameworks]
```

### Building
```bash
[build commands based on build_tools]
```

## Next Steps

1. Review the architecture diagram in `architecture/`
2. Check `ai-docs/` for library documentation
3. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution guidelines
4. Run the test suite to verify setup
```

### 7. Create AI-Docs Index Entry (Optional)

If new documentation sources were recommended, offer to run:
```
/ai-dev-kit:docs-add [url] [name]
```

For each recommended source.

## Completion

Report:
- Stack detected: [summary]
- Standards found: [summary]
- Docs available: [count]
- Docs recommended: [count]
- ONBOARDING.md created: [path]

## Notes

- This command is read-only except for creating ONBOARDING.md
- For deep architecture analysis, follow up with `/ai-dev-kit:explore-architecture`
- For implementation planning, follow up with `/ai-dev-kit:plan`
